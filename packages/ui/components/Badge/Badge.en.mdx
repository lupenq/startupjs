# Badge

Badge is small status descriptors for UI elements. Badges should have a label for accessibility and clear comprehension. When the label is not defined, a badge becomes icon-only.

```js
import { Badge } from '@startupjs/ui'
```

## Simple exmaple

```jsx example
return (
  <Badge>
    <Div styleName='child'/>
  </Badge>
)
```

## Variants

Badges are of two types: `default` and `dot`. `default` it is the most frequently used and the default specified. `dot` turns the icon into a small dot, this can be used as a message that something has changed without content.

```jsx example
return (
  <Row>
    <Badge label='10'>
      <Div styleName='child' pushed/>
    </Badge>
    <Badge variant='dot'>
      <Div styleName='child' pushed/>
    </Badge>
  </Row>
)
```

## Colors

Color is `primary` by default. It can be changed by passing color name from the config colors to `color` property. Possible values of property can be found in the `Sandbox` section at the bottom of the page.

```jsx example
return (
  <Badge color='error'>
    <Div styleName='child' pushed/>
  </Badge>
)
```

## Position

Badges come in two positions: `top` and `bottom`. Default value is `top`.

```jsx example
return (
  <Row>
    <Badge>
      <Div styleName='child' pushed/>
    </Badge>
    <Badge position='bottom'>
      <Div styleName='child' pushed/>
    </Badge>
  </Row>
)
```

## Icons

Icon can be added using `icon` property.

```jsx example
return (
  <Badge icon={faThumbsUp} label='10+' color='success'>
    <Div styleName='child' pushed/>
  </Badge>
)
```

## Sandbox

<Sandbox Component={Badge} />
